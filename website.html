<h2> "Goldie" (07/2023) digital portrait by Joseph McMillan </h2>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/Joe/Desktop/goldie%20update.PNG">
<p> This piece represents the issue within capitalism. This digital artwork expresses how society often loses itself within the value of money, the person depicted has their iris and pupil as a australian dollar coin and all around them is the golden pile of coins. It is said that someone's eyes is the key to their heart and soul but the fact that this person has their indiviuality ripped away and replaced by money shows the deeper meaning that money shouldn't be used for exchange of who you are and your indiviuality.
